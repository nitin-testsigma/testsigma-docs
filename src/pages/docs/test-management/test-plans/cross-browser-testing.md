Cross browser testing is a type of non-functional testing that ensures the functionality of applications across different browser-OS combinations and devices. It ensures that the application works as expected on well-known web browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari, and various OS, such as Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. 


Cross browser testing also evaluates the performance of applications on different devices, such as smartphones, tablets, desktops, and laptops, produced by different manufacturers. This testing approach ensures that your application provides an optimal user experience, regardless of the user's choice of browser, OS, or device. With cross browser testing, you can identify and address compatibility issues, which enhances the usability of your application for a wider audience.
